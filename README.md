## 1.Multiple Victim Rescue Path Finder using BFS
Implements **Breadth First Search (BFS)** to find optimal paths from a relief centre to multiple victim areas in a city graph. Useful in **disaster management, smart city planning, and AI pathfinding**.
## Problem Statement
Rescue teams need quick shortest routes to multiple victims during emergencies. This project demonstrates **multi-goal BFS traversal** to solve this efficiently.
